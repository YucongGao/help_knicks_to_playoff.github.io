## Linear Regression

### Variable description

After ruling out variables with strong correlation, we include variables as follow:
Dependent variable is the score of each game, denoted by pts (points).
Independent variables are selected from both **offensive** aspect and **defensive** aspect.

For the offensive level, variables include:

* fg3_pct: proportion of three points shooting
* fg_pct: proportion of field goals attempted
* fg_pct: proportion of free throw
* oreb: average offensive rebounds per game
* ast: average assists per games

As for the defensive level, variables include:

* stl: steals of each game
* blk: blocks of each game
* dreb: defensive rebounds of each game
* tov: turnovers of each game
* pf: personal foul of each game

### Modelling

Use step function to choose a model by AIC in a Stepwise algorithm.

```{r}
ln_regre = lm(pts ~fg_pct+fg3_pct+ft_pct+oreb+dreb+ast+stl+blk+tov+pf,data = regre_df)
summary(ln_regre)
linear.step = step(ln_regre,direction="both")
summary(linear.step)
```

The adjusted R square for the full model is 0.6916, that is to say 69.16% of variances in the response variable can be explained by the predictors. 


### Model diagnostic


1). to check if the error term is normally distributed with mean 0.
```{r}
ggplot(data = ln_regre , aes(x = ln_regre$residuals)) + geom_histogram()
```

Condition 1 is met.

2). to check if the error term is independent of the dependent variable.
```{r}
ggplot(data = ln_regre, aes(x = ln_regre$fitted.values, y = ln_regre$residuals)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Condition 2 is met as we cannot see an obvious tendency of errors.

### Interpretation of model coefficients

According to model ln_regre,the equation will look like this.

All variables selected are significant in this linear regression model.

For each additional 0.1 of proportion of field goals attempted, the points will increase 13.9.
 
For each additional 0.1 of proportion three points shooting, the points will increase 1.45.

For each additional 0.1 of proportion of free throw, the points will increase 2.43.
 
For each additional 1 of offensive rebounds per game, the points will increase 0.8.
 
For each additional 1 of defensive rebounds per games, the points will increase 0.56.

For each additional 1 of steals per game, the points will increase 0.57.

For each additional 1 of assists per game, the points will increase 0.45.

For each additional 1 of blocks per game, the points will decrease 0.15.

For each additional 1 of turnovers per game, the points will decrease 0.68.

For each additional 1 of  personal foul per game, the points will decrease 0.4.
